This is a more efficient and flexible replacement of my Bash spaghetti made for the same purpose. Supports output to a terminal or to the xfce4-panel genmon applet (with Pango markup). Needs FontAwesome to display icons.

The name is an abbreviation of Li(nux) + Mon(itor), and „lemon“ in Russian.

# Prerequisitions

Requires `libsensors`.

The `ATA_HDDTEMP` command requires root permissions to work.

Some icons require `Font Awesome` to be installed.
